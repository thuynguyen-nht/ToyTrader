# ToyTrader
Fully Working React App 

### About Our App
This is a application made using React.  This is designed to help families get rid of extra toys that they no longer want or need.  There is a feature for clients to sign up and then login to the application so that they can add the toy listing.  Users can also save a toy that they like by using the heart, to their saved toy page.  Users also have the ability to contact by other users by email if they see a toy that interests them.  Users can also search for a toy, location, user, or description in the search bar. Once a toy is sold the user can then delete the toy from the database.
